## LUNAR CONVERTER

Play with the lunar converter [here](https://lunar-converter.netlify.com/)

The Lunar Converter allows you to find Chinese New Year and Qingming (Tomb Sweeping day) for any given year, as well as your original and current Chinese birthday in the Western Gregorian calendar. More about why I made this [here.](https://cloppy.space/blog/lunar-converter-app)
